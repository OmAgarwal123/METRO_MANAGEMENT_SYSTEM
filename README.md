# METRO_MANAGEMENT_SYSTEM
Metro Management System: A C++ application for efficient metro travel, featuring route planning, shortest path (DFS &amp; Dijkstra), and metro card integration. It uses adjacency lists for graph-based station management, secure user accounts, and dynamic travel options. Future plans include real-time data and a GUI.
