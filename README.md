# METRO_MANAGEMENT_SYSTEM
A robust and user-friendly application designed to optimize metro travel and enhance commuter experiences. This project, developed in C++, integrates advanced algorithms and data structures to provide comprehensive solutions for metro network management.

Key Features:

Route Planning: Users can explore all possible paths between stations, find the shortest distance, or optimize for minimum/maximum stations.
Graph-Based Design: Efficient adjacency list representation for metro stations and connections.
Advanced Algorithms: Employs Depth First Search (DFS) for pathfinding and Dijkstra's Algorithm for shortest route calculation.
Metro Card Integration: Supports fare payments and real-time balance updates for seamless travel.
User Management: Includes secure registration, login, and metro card balance management.
Technical Highlights:

Object-Oriented Programming with encapsulated classes for stations and users.
Utilization of vectors, maps, and sets to manage station data and paths.
Dynamic options for route preferences tailored to user needs.
Future Enhancements:

Integration of real-time metro data for schedules and delays.
Development of a graphical user interface (GUI) for improved usability.
Incorporation of dynamic fare calculation and personalized route recommendations.
This project simulates a metro system efficiently, providing a foundation for real-world applications in urban transit management.

Feel free to explore the code and contribute to further improvements!
